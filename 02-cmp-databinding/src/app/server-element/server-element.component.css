/* Before adding the content below, blueprint elements were not colored blue, even though the same style has
already been applied in the parent component (AppComponent). This is not the defaul CSS behavior, which would apply
the style to all template files.
So why this happens?
This is enforced by Angular, and called view encapsulation. The compiler adds a common attribute to all HTML
elements inside one component, adding this attribute also to the corresponding component CSS file. This ensures
that the style created in a component.css file is only applied to that component.
(This is a feature similar to what could be done by "Shadow DOM", a technology which is not supported on every
browser) */
